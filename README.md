 # App Brainstorming

My favorite applications and why!
1. LinkedIn: Adding featured media/posts/experiences; Many ways to "react" to posts; Can see what other people's connections are up to if they react to the post
2. Instagram: For you page gives you personalized content; Can choose which message to respond to specifically
3. Netflix: Multiple profiles can be made; You can save movies/shows to your collection

My app idea:
I would like to make an app that improves a previous project of mine which allowed users to input a movie or tv show of their choice and find out on what streaming platforms they can find it. It was called "ReelRadar" and my idea builds off of it. I would like to build an iOS version of it as it would make it more convenient to access and I would like to add in a saved feature so that users can store a list of movies they can watch. Furthermore, I would like to add a section where people can see the trending movies or tv shows on specific platforms. And last but not least, dark mode is a must!
